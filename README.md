# Bias for estimating life expectancy from age at death: A simulation approach applied to Morquio Syndrome A
Life expectancy is accurate when we assess the life length of a cohort of individuals born in the same year and followed since their births to their deaths. Due to the difficulties and time consuming of following a cohort, we usually assess life expectancy based on death rates. However, this may cause bias since we neglect the possible changes in the environment or medical improvements that influence the length of life.To investigate whether there is bias when assessing life expectancy on death data, we simulate the survival data of individuals with Morquio syndrome A under four different scenarios. Under different scenarios, we calculate their means and medians of survival time of individuals deceased in the last 36 years and compare them with expected survival time at the end of the period.
